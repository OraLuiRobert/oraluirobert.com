    "description": "#Robert's Hour experience teaches children what it means to live healthily, to respect their body and to make better choices in life. Because it is a program that benefits the mind and body greatly, it improves their posture, resistance, equilibrium, coordination, attention and strengthens their immune system. Furthermore, children gain social skills and learn from a young age to follow their goals."
